It is considered to be a skillful game and has been popularized among people for generations. The snake in the Snake game is controlled using the four direction buttons relative to the direction it is headed in. The playerâ€™s objective in the game is to achieve maximum points as possible by collecting food or fruits. The player loses once the snake hits the wall or hits itself.
